"""
Shared REASON-stage runner. Both /upload (chunks already in memory
right after NORMALIZE) and /analyze (chunks re-fetched from Qdrant for
a standalone re-run) call this so the extract -> risk -> summarize+
recommend -> persist sequence and its failure handling exist in one
place instead of two copies. Three sequential Groq calls -- summary and
recommendations used to be separate calls despite depending on
identical inputs (extraction + risk, never raw chunks), so they're
merged into one (see
reasoning_service.generate_summary_and_recommendations), and review
extraction was dropped entirely, purely to cut request overhead given
how easily Groq's free-tier daily quota gets exhausted by a single
investigation.
