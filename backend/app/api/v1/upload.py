"""
Upload endpoint: saves PDFs to Cloudinary, creates the Investigation
row (status=pending), and kicks off the full pipeline as a background
task -- GATHER -> NORMALIZE -> REASON -> PERSIST, all the way through
to status=completed. Previously this stopped after NORMALIZE and
expected a separate /analyze call to finish the job; that call was
never actually wired up by the frontend, so investigations sat at
"gathered" forever. Now the REASON stage runs automatically using the
chunks already produced by NORMALIZE, no re-gathering or second HTTP
call needed.
