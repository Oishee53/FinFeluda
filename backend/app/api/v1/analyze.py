"""
Standalone re-run of the REASON stage for an investigation whose data
has already been gathered. Reads the chunks /upload's pipeline already
stored in Qdrant instead of re-gathering from scratch -- this also
means it doesn't need pdf_paths (server-only temp paths the frontend
never has, which made the old implementation uncallable for PDF-backed
investigations). Useful for retrying analysis after a transient Groq
failure, or re-analyzing after prompts/models change.
